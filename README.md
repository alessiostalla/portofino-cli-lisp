# portofino-cli
Command-line utilities for ManyDesigns Portofino.

This is a work in progress. Only few commands are supported at the moment and error handling is not very user-friendly.

Generally, commands work by connecting to a Portofino running server â€“ by default, `http://localhost:8080/`. You can change the address with a few cli switches:
```
--host www.example.com
--port 12345
--path my-app/api
--protocol https
```
The above will connect to a Portofino instance running at `https://www.example.com:12345/my-app/api`.

In the future, we'll also support automatically launching a Portofino server as soon as the first command is issued. However, that likely requires modifications or extensions to Portofino itself.

## Usage
Invoking the cli without any arguments prints some help text that you can use to discover commands.
```
$ ./portofino
Please, specify a command.

Here is a list of all supported commands:

These commands are supported:

 * action - Commands for working with resource-actions
 * db - Commands for working with databases
 * login - Login to a running Portofino instance
 * logout - Log out deleting the stored token
 * new - Create a new Portofino project
 ```
 
Similarly you can discover sub-commands by typing them:
```
$ ./portofino action
Please, specify a command.

Here is a list of all supported commands:

These commands are supported:

 * create - Create a new resource-action
 * delete - Delete an action
 * list-types - List resource-action types
 ```

An interactive REPL is planned but not yet available.

## Installation

We don't provide (yet) binary packages, though I'm working on it. So, you'll have to build portofino-cli yourself. Please follow the build instructions.

## Building

First, clone this repo if you haven't done already:
```
git clone https://github.com/alessiostalla/portofino-cli
```
Make sure you have Roswell installed by following [its installation guide](https://github.com/roswell/roswell/wiki/Installation).

Run the following command (using a Bash-compatible shell which should also be available in recent versions of Windows with WSL):
```
ros run -- --eval "(progn (asdf:load-asd \"`pwd`/portofino-cli.asd\") (ql:quickload :portofino-cli/executable))"
```

An executable file named "portofino" should be created. On Windows, you may rename it to "portofino.exe".
 
## License
 
Portofino-cli is licensed under the AGPL. For normal use on your local computer this means that you're basically free to use it without problems. If, however, you build any kind of tool or service on top of it, you need to release its source code.
You can open an issue if you'd like to use portofino-cli as a component in a tool or service and require a more business-friendly license.
